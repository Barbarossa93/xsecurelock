To build the package use git-buildpackage like so:

  gbp buildpackage --git-debian-branch=debian -uc -us


For dev builds before tagging a new release you can use this invocation:

  gbp buildpackage --git-debian-branch=debian --git-upstream-tree=SLOPPY -uc -us


Unfortunately the tests depend on quite a lot (they're full fledged integration
tests) and are not ready to run automatically yet (e.g. they have timing
dependencies, in other words, they're flaky).
