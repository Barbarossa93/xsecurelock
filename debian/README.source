To build the package use git-buildpackage from the repository root like so:

  mkdir -p ../build-area
  uscan --force-download --destdir ../build-area
  gbp buildpackage --git-debian-branch=debian -uc -us --git-tarball-dir=../build-area --git-export-dir=../build-area


Unfortunately the tests depend on quite a lot (they're full fledged integration
tests) and are not ready to run automatically yet (e.g. they have timing
dependencies, in other words, they're flaky).
