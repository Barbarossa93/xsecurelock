xsecurelock (1.6.0-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Upstream version 1.6.0
  * Changes from upstream version 1.6.0
    * Make dimmer more nvidia driver friendly, fixing a crash on large
      multi-monitor configurations by limiting the complexity of render
      calls; controlled using XSECURELOCK_DIM_MAX_FILL_SIZE.
    * Add a weaker force-grab method that merely steals input focus;
      XSECURELOCK_FORCE_GRAB still controls the stronger method, but it
      should trigger less often now.
    * Fix crash with colored emoji fonts (still can't render emoji;
      we're now simply rejecting fonts Xft cannot handle).
    * Also run the switch user dialog on Ctrl-Alt-Zero as an alternative
      to Ctrl-Alt-Oh; more user friendly as in some fonts, Ctrl-Alt-O
      looks like both.
    * XFlush when doing things affecting X11 idle timers.

xsecurelock (1.5.1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Upstream version 1.5.1
  * Bump Standards-Version from 4.1.4 to 4.3.0
  * Changes from upstream version 1.5.1
    * XSECURELOCK_FORCE_GRAB no longer sometimes fails to re-map the unmapped
      windows in case locking fails despite the forcing. Previously, a missing
      XSync call led to the re-mapping sometimes not taking effect.
  * Changes from upstream version 1.5.0
    * Always wake up from mouse motion events.
    * Set PAM_RHOST to "localhost" as recommended by the Linux-PAM manual; add
      a feature to disable setting this field entirely as a workaround for
      pam_fprintd.
    * Remove some stderr spam.
    * Detect VNC and Chrome Remote Desktop servers and refuse to lock them, as
      locking them would not make much sense (can be overridden).
    * Allow the helpers directory to be recreated while xsecurelock is
      running. Fixes issues like "cannot unlock after unattended package
      upgrade".
